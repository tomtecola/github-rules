> You can use one account for multiple purposes, such as for personal use and business use. We do not recommend creating more than one account. For more information, see "Merging multiple user accounts."  

## JIRA integration

### Link your branches, code commits and Pull Requests with JIRA
1. Use **JIRA ticket ID as your working branch name** (usually off from a development branch)
2. **Start your commit message with a proper JIRA ID**. If your commit consists of more than two tickets, please use 2 JIRA ID (e.g. "APP-69 APP-70") instead of short form ("APP-69/70")
